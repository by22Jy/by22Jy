## 📝 Current Work
I'm currently working on a **comprehensive guide for Computer Science students at Minzu University**.

Since the rise of LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5) in 2023, many have realized their limitations. **Developer roles** remain a hot topic during fall recruitment.  
Whether you're aiming for graduate studies or a job, I hope this guide helps you as a fellow Minzu University student! 🎓

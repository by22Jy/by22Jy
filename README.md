## About Me 😃
* Class of 2022, Computer Science student at Minzu University of China. My goal is to secure a BAT (Bytedance/Alibaba/Tencent) SP/SSP offer in the 2026 fall recruitment season. 🏁
* Tech Stack: Java, Python, Golang, front-end and anything you need! 🤏
* Open Source Courses: CSAPP, MIT 6.824, NJU Operating System 👓
* Currently: Working at Bytedance. Feel free to contact me for campus recruitment or internship referrals. 📞

## Current Work ✏️
I'm currently working on a comprehensive guide for Computer Science students at Minzu University. Since the emergence of LLMs like GPT-3.5 in 2023, many have started to realize their limitations. **Developer roles** remain a hot topic for fall recruitment.
Whether you plan to pursue graduate studies or aim for a job in the fall recruitment season, I hope this guide can help you, as a fellow Minzu University student. 🎓
